# AVT PanzerATK V0

yo, welcome to **PMC AEVIATHAN** (ЧВК АЭВИАФАН). this is a lowkey efficient tank battle simulator built with Go. no loops, no clutter, just straight vibes and `if-else` logic. fr fr.

## tl;dr
basically, you pick a tank, and we calculate if you're gonna bake the enemy or get cooked. we’re using **direct indexing** $O(1)$ because we don't have time for `for` loops. efficiency is the move.

## the lineup
* **JagdPanzer** (the heavy hitter 💥)
* **T34** (the classic 🎖️)
* **PZ_IV** (the balanced king 👑)

## tech stack
- **Language:** Go (Golang)
- **Logic:** pure `if-else` (no loops allowed here)
- **UI:** ASCII Art via `go-figure` & some drip from `fatih/color`

## how to run
make sure you got the dependencies then just hit:
```bash
go run .
